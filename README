Modified version of the "Hack" typeface
=======================================

This is the font I use in my Emacs setup[0].  I built it using the
alternative glyphs repo[1], provided by the author of "Hack"[2], as
well as the build instruction documented therein.

The patches concern the following:

+ Use slabbed version of letter "i" only for the Regular and Bold
  variants (roman forms).  Italics and Bold Italics will use the default
  slab-less glyph.

+ Use a slab-less "1" numeral, which clearly distinguish it from the
  slabbed letter "i".

+ Use "3" with a flat top in Regular and Bold variants.  Leave it
  unchanged for their italicised counterparts.

+ Use knife variant of "f" for the Italic and Bold Italic sets.  The
  default glyph remains unchanged for Regular and Bold.

+ Use dotted zero in Regular and Bold sets, while reverting to diamond
  zero for the italic variants.  The use of a dot and a diamond is
  necessary to offer the impression of similarity between roman and
  italic glyph variations: it ensures that the "0" remains unambiguous.
