Modified version of the "Hack" typeface
=======================================

This is the font I use in my Emacs setup[0].  I built it using the
alternative glyphs repo[1], provided by the author of "Hack"[2], as
well as the build instruction documented therein.

Quoting from my init file on the scope of my modifications[3]:

	+ Use slabbed version of letter "i" /only/ for the Regular and
	  Bold variants.  Italics and Bold Italics will use the default
	  slab-less glyph.

	+ Use a slab-less "1", which clearly disambiguates it from slabbed
	  "i".

	+ Use "3" with a flat top in Regular and Bold variants.  Leave
	  unchanged for their italicised counterparts.

	+ Use knife variant of "f" for the Italic and Bold Italic sets.
	  The default glyph remains unchanged for Regular and Bold.

	+ Use dotted zero in Regular and Bold sets, while reverting to
	  diamond zero for the italic variants.  The use of a dot and a
	  diamond is necessary to offer the /impression/ of similarity
	  between roman and italic glyph variations.

These files were built on 2019-09-07 on a Debian 10 system.  They are
licensed under the same terms as Hack itself (see COPYING).
